# What is Falsilla De Wulff and How to Use It?
 
Falsilla De Wulff is a tool that helps geologists to draw stereographic projections of crystallographic planes and directions. It is also known as Wulff net or stereonet. It consists of a spherical grid of meridians and parallels that represent the orientation of planes and lines in three-dimensional space. Falsilla De Wulff can be used to visualize the symmetry of crystals, to determine the angular relationships between planes and directions, and to solve problems involving structural geology, crystallography, and mineralogy.

## How to Draw Stereographic Projections Using Falsilla De Wulff?
 
To draw stereographic projections using Falsilla De Wulff, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Choose a reference sphere that represents the crystal or the object you want to project. The center of the sphere is called the pole, and the equator of the sphere is called the primitive circle.
2. Choose a projection plane that intersects the sphere at the primitive circle. The projection plane can be either horizontal (equatorial projection) or vertical (polar projection).
3. Choose a point of view from which you will look at the projection plane. The point of view can be either above (upper hemisphere projection) or below (lower hemisphere projection) the projection plane.
4. For each plane or direction that you want to project, find its intersection with the sphere and draw a line from the pole to that point. This line is called the trace of the plane or direction.
5. Project the trace of the plane or direction onto the projection plane by drawing a perpendicular line from the trace to the primitive circle. The point where this line meets the primitive circle is called the pole of the plane or direction.
6. Mark the pole of the plane or direction on Falsilla De Wulff using a symbol that indicates its type and orientation. For example, you can use a cross (+) for planes, a dot (.) for directions, and an arrow (->) for vectors.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all the planes and directions that you want to project.

## Examples of Stereographic Projections Using Falsilla De Wulff
 
Here are some examples of stereographic projections using Falsilla De Wulff for some common crystallographic elements:
 
### Cubic Crystal System
 
The cubic crystal system has four three-fold axes along [111], [1-1-1], [11-1], and [1-11], six four-fold axes along [100], [010], [001], [0-10], [00-1], and [-100], and three two-fold axes along [110], [101], and [011]. To draw a stereographic projection of these axes using Falsilla De Wulff, we can use an equatorial projection with an upper hemisphere point of view. The steps are as follows:

1. Choose a reference sphere that represents a cubic crystal. The center of the sphere is the pole, and the equator of the sphere is the primitive circle.
2. Choose an equatorial projection plane that intersects the sphere at the primitive circle.
3. Choose an upper hemisphere point of view from which you will look at the projection plane.
4. For each three-fold axis, find its intersection with the sphere and draw a line from the pole to that point. This line is the trace of the axis.
5. Project the trace of the axis onto the projection plane by drawing a perpendicular line from
the trace to the primitive circle. The point where this line meets the primitive circle is
the pole of
the axis.
